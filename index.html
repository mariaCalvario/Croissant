        Le Croissant - The history behind the pastry 🥐
      </h1>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Where was the croissant born?</h2>
      <p class="mt-3">
        You’ve probably already read elsewhere the shocking news: croissants
        weren’t invented in France🙀 <br />
        As with every aspect of tracing the croissant’s tortuous history,
        however, it’s actually a bit more complicated than that. <br />
        <br />
        Most food historians trace the origins of the croissant to Austria and
        elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where small pastries called kipferl had
        been made since at least the 13th century, according to numerous
        records. While little is known about their original composition, kipferl
        were simple pastries that might be served plain or with nuts.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">How did the croissant get to France? 🇫🇷</h2>
      <p class="mt-3">
        The story of how Austrian kipferl arrived in France is, as you might
        guess, another disputed one. For years, it was casually asserted that
        Queen Marie Antoinette, a native of Austria, introduced it to the court
        at Versailles in 1770 after her marriage to King Louis XVI. <br />
        But historians generally say this account is incorrect, and that the
        baked good only became popular in France during the 19th century. <br />
        <br />
        They attribute the arrival of the kipferl to a bakery opened in Paris in
        1837-1839 by Austrian-born bakers August Zang and Ernest Schwartzer.
        Called La Boulangerie Viennoise (or simply “Zang’s”), it offered a
        variety of Austrian-style baked goods, including kipferl. Zang had a
        patented steam oven that yielded a characteristic sheen of the finished
        creations– a quality that’s still considered ideal to this day on a good
        croissant.
